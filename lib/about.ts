  bio: `I've always loved puzzles and problem solving. I also have always been a "people person", and was drawn to psychology after a serendipitous change to my schedule in first year of my undergrad. From that moment, I was able to combine my love of problem solving with my interest in humans and their behaviours.

  As a scientist with a PhD in cognitive psychology and a postdoctoral focus in cognitive neuroscience, I bring my love of science to my creative endeavors. My transition into data science deepened my fascination with patterns and variations on a theme, reflecting the way that memories are changed with each retrieval, maintaining some characteristics but often changing in unexpected ways. Living in the Rockies has further inspired my work, intertwining my love for the outdoors with photography and textile arts.
  
  My artistic practice honors my loved ones. I create with someone in mind, channeling my emotions into the work, while embracing my role as a process artist. I enjoy tinkering and learning new techniques to expand my creative toolkit. This exploration parallels my work in data science and coding, where myriad ways exist to solve problems and visualize patterns.`,
